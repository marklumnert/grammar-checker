Grammar Checker (Offline) is an extension that lets you check American English grammar for any input text. 

To work with this addon, please open the app interface by pressing the toolbar button. By default, the interface opens in a standalone window. But you can open it in a tab or toolbar popup as well. To do so, right-click the toolbar button and choose the desired context from the context menu. Once the app interface is open, please write or paste a text; you can also drag a .txt file into the textarea on the left side. Then, wait for the app to perform the grammar checks; you can see the grammar suggestions on the right side. For a reasonable-length text (a page or two), the time required to perform the check is usually around a few seconds. You can review each grammar suggestion and either Accept or Dismiss the item. 

Note 1: This extension uses the local Harper.js engine (https://github.com/Automattic/harper) to check grammar. It does NOT rely on any servers to send or receive text therefore, it can work Offline without an internet connection.  

Note 2: This app is still a work in progress, therefore you might see some bugs or performance issues when working with this addon.
